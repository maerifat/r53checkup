  ### Every time you run this tool it will open up your default browser to authorize the device. You don't need any credentials or profiles separately to make it work.

- Run accross all accounts
  - With out using --accounts/-a, the tool will gather all accounts you have privilege to and fetch details of dns records. . Example:  
    - _r53collector -u https://d-1010ad440.awsapps.com/start_
  ```python
  r53collector -u <SSO Start URL>
  
- Run accross selective account[s].
  - To get results from selective accounts, use --accounts/-a. Multiple accounts can be selected separated by comma. Example:
    - _r53collector -u https://d-1010ad440.awsapps.com/start -a 144313609872,330936112098,692902471034_
  ```python
  r53collector -u <SSO Start URL> -a <Account IDs> 

- Filter record types.
  - To get desired DNS record types only, use -types/-t. Multiple types can be selected separated by comma. Example:
    - _r53collector -u https://d-1010ad440.awsapps.com/start -t cname,a,aaaa_
  ```python
  r53collector -u <SSO Start URL> -t <Record Type> 

- Exclude record names using regex.
  - If you want to filterout the undesired subdomains(record names) like containing '\_domainkey' or '\_dkim' or records starting with '\_', you can select regex after --exclude/-e. Example:
    - _r53collector -u https://d-1010ad440.awsapps.com/start -e "^\_.\*|.\*\_(domainkey|dkim).\*"_
  ```python
  r53collector -u <SSO Start URL> -e <Regex> 

- Save output to a file.
  - If you want to save the output to a file, use --output/-o. You have two format options xlsx(recommended) and txt. Format is recognised from the filename extension. Txt extension is recommended only in case you want to store subdomains in a text file, which can be later used to feed other tools for reconnaissance . Example:
    - _r53collector -u https://d-1010ad440.awsapps.com/start -o myrecords.xlsx_
  ```python
  r53collector -u <SSO Start URL> -o <Output FileLocation> 

- check if the record is dangling.
  - If you want to check whether the DNS record is dangling or not, use --check-dangling/-cd . Use output filename extension as xlsx along with it. Example: 
    - _r53collector -u https://d-1010ad440.awsapps.com/start -cd -o myrecords.xlsx_
  ```python
  r53collector -u <SSO Start URL> -cd -o <Output FileLocation> 

- Disable verbose.
  - If you want to check whether the DNS record is dangling or not, use --no-verbose/-nc . Example: 
    - _r53collector -u https://d-1010ad440.awsapps.com/start -cd -o myrecords.xlsx -nc_
  ```python
  r53collector -u <SSO Start URL> -cd -o <Output FileLocation> -nc 

- List unique subdomains.
  - If you want to only list unique subdomains, use --list/-l . This is helpful while combining it with other tools using pipe. Example: 
    - _r53collector -u https://d-1010ad440.awsapps.com/start -l_
  ```python
  r53collector -u <SSO Start URL>  -l
